# README: RFC:3c - HTTP Protocol with Feline Enhancements

**Overview**

RFC:3c introduces delightful modifications to the standard HTTP protocol to ~~foster a more heartwarming and playful online experience. Inspired by the inherent joy and charm of feline communication, this RFC aims to inject a touch of whimsy into web interactions.~~ meow

**Key Provisions**

1. **Server Responses with a Pet-Like Quality:** All server responses adhering to this RFC must exhibit qualities akin to those of a beloved pet. This includes the use of friendly language, playful tone, and expressive punctuation.
2. **Inclusion of ":3":**  Servers must incorporate the ":3" emoticon into responses, either:
    * Randomly, with a 50% probability per response.
    * In every response
3. **Meow Frequency:** Servers are obligated to respond with a "meow" sound in at least 80% of HTTP requests received. This auditory element further enhances the immersive, pet-like experience.

**Implementation Notes**

* **Language and Tone:**  Server responses should avoid overly formal language. Encourage the use of contractions, exclamations, and terms of endearment (e.g., "mrreeeeoooop mew mew mew >:3c").
* **:3 Variations:** Implementations may experiment with variations of the ":3" emoticon, such as "=^w^=" or ">.<".
* **Meow Implementation:** The "meow" sound can be delivered via:
    * Textual representation ("meow")
    * Creative interpretations (e.g., ASCII art meows)

**Example Exchange**
```bash
curl -X PET sophari.org
Answer: HTTP 200
Text: mrrrp yip meow meow
```
